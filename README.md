# C ADTs and Helper Functions

An ever-expanding codebase of helper functions and implementations for data structures.

Code is licensed under the unlicense, so feel free to copy, reproduce, etc.

This project aims to build a reuseable codebase for the C Programming Language.

## How to compile & test

If the folder is completed, meaning it has a completed header file, a main file and a makefile, run the following:
```
cd (folder of choice)
make
./main
```
If there is also a test file, you can run:
```
make test
./test
```
