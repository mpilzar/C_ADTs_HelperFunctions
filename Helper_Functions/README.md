The helper functions included in this folder are meant to be copy and pasted into
any program according to one's needs. They are not meant to be included as header
files, which is why .h files are not included in this part of the repository.

All functions in this repository have been tested. (Unless
explicitly stated otherwise).

Maybe in the future I will add main.c files with Makefile to display functionality.
